# 🏛️ EDAPI: Art Institute of Chicago Gallery

A responsive web application that interacts with the **Art Institute of Chicago API** to display a curated collection of artworks, developed as a project for my Web Application Development studies.

## 💖 Special Dedication
Although I had the freedom to choose any public API for this assignment, I specifically selected this one for a **very special person in my life who deeply loves art**. This virtual gallery was built with you in mind.

* **High-Res Viewer:** Open images in full quality with a direct download option.
